the example takes about 30s to run:

# my standard unix dictionary didn't have "darkling"
~ wget http://dzl.no-ip.org/dict/owl1.bz2
~ bunzip owl1.bz2
~ time < examples/1 cager -d owl1
Loading dictionary: "owl1"
Considering wordset: ["ZFY","TM","ZGM","LMGM","ZA","HF","Z","YZGJRBFI","QRZBF","ATMQX","TBXL","WHFPNAMY","ZRZGVA","HP","AXGNIIRM","PRBILX","TLMGM","BIFHGZFX","ZGVBMA","WRZAL","UO","FBILX"]
AND WE ARE HERE AS ON A DARKLING PLAIN SWEPT WITH CONFUSED ALARMS OF STRUGGLE AND FLIGHT WHERE IGNORANT ARMIES CLASH BY NIGHT
.
cager -d owl1 < examples/1  31.77s user 0.08s system 97% cpu 32.527 total

possible improvements:
- could try to auto-detect non-words (would greatly increase search time?)
- efficiency could probably be much better in general anyway
